        <p>
          &bull; Other companies in our group who provide services to us.

        <p>
          Countries outside of the European Economic Area (<strong>EEA</strong>) do not always offer the same levels of
          protection to your personal data, so European law has prohibited transfers of personal data outside of the EEA
          unless the transfer meets certain criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of our third parties service providers are based outside the European Economic Area (<strong>EEA</strong>
          ) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.
        </p>

        <p>
          &bull; We will only transfer your personal data to countries that the European Commission have approved as
          providing an adequate level of protection for personal data by; or
          <br />
          &bull; Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts or codes of conduct or
          certification mechanisms approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it
          has in Europe; or
          <br />
          &bull; If we use US-based providers that are part of EU-US Privacy Shield, we may transfer data to them, as
          they have equivalent safeguards in place.
          <br />
          If none of the above safeguards is available, we may request your explicit consent to the specific transfer.
          You will have the right to withdraw this consent at any time.

          applicable regulator of a breach if we are legally required to.

          potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, the processing purposes, if these can be achieved
